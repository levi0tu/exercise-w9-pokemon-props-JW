# React Pokemon Props Exercise

In this week’s session you will practice react basics and you will work on applying the concepts that we have learned. 

### Instructions:
In the /src/data.json, we've included a data object that contains some pokemon data. You can import this JSON file into a component using import data from './data.json'. The result of importing the JSON is a variable called data which includes the full JSON object. 

Use this to pass down the data from the parent component to its child component. Using the data.json you will create a list of pokemons. We've created the necessary components for you, now it's up to you to pass the props properly to these components. Don’t forget the key attribute to avoid any console errors 😉

## Getting Started with the Project

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server:

Once cloned, navigate to the project's root directory and this project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage its dependencies.

The command below is a combination of installing dependencies, opening up the project on VS Code and it will run a development server on your terminal.

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev
```
